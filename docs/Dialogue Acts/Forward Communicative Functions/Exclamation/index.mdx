```
(oh|well|i mean|NIL) (gosh|goodness|boy|good grief|jeez|heavens|shoot|gee whiz)
```

## Examples

```
(61) A: No no!
---
(61) -- Exclamation --> (61)
```

```
(619) Messenger: And Tidal Palace
(620) Pilot: K
(621) Messenger: Bronze gate
(622) Messenger: Howling Garden.
(623) Pilot: Oh my Gosh!
---
(623) -- Exclamation --> (619)
```
If previous slash unit can be identified as leading to the reaction, it can be used as the target argument.
In this case, the Pilot reacts to an important tile being flooded in the game Forbidden Island.
