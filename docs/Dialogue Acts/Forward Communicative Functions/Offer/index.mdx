## Examples

```
<in a collaborative board game>

(81) Engineer: Do you guys have any suggestions?
(82) Pilot: Um
(83) Engineer: I could try to get to the Cave of Shadows.
---
(83) -- Offer --> (81)
```
The Engineer offers to try to move to a particular place on the board.

```
(306) Pilot: ok so
(307) Pilot: Should I move here and then turn that over?
---
(307) -- Offer --> (306)
```
The Pilot asks the the group if they should take a specific action,
which is both a question and an offer, as the answer 'yes' commits the speaker to a course of action.

```
(526) Pilot: But I need one more to fly you out
(527) Engineer: I have, I have one.
---
(527) -- Offer --> (526)
```
An Offer can also be implicit, as in (527), where the Engineer announces they have a resource (a card) in response to the Pilot declaring they need one.
This is implicitly an offer to give the Pilot that card, which would allow them to take the action of flying out.
