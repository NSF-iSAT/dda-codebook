## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a question which has intention is to retrieve new information from other parties.
Note that some syntactic question format utterance may not be a question/info-request
i.e. A: Can you pass the salt?
this is actually an Action Directive given the intention is not genuinely asking for more information, but rather requesting an action to be taken by the addressee.

DDA does not distinguish between sub-types of information requesting questions, such as yes/no questions, wh-questions, etc.

The target argument of a QuestionInfoRequest can be self-pointing (same as source) if the speaker is asking a question starting a new thread.
Otherwise, the target argument is the previous turn which 'prompts' the question.

## Examples

```
(1) A: Do you have to have any special training?

(1) -- QuestionInfoRequest --> (1)

```
(159) A: we're adding your name into it.
