## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument commits the speaker to some future course of action, **regardless of the agreement of the addressee.**
The strongest form of a commitment is a promise, but commitments can also be weaker, and not necessarily binding.

For example "I'll probably be there around 3" is a weak commitment to arrive at 3pm, leaving open the possibility of not fulfilling the commitment.
However it is not an offer, as it is not in any way conditioned on the agreement of the addressee.

## Examples

```
(1) A: Let me see,
(2) A: I don't know if that took or not,
(3) A: I'll do it again.
---
(3) -- Commit --> (1)
```
A is committing to redoing an action, regardless of whether the addressee agrees or not.

```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(13) Messenger: I'm just gonna shore this one up.
---
(13) -- Commit --> (13)
```
In gameplay, players often narrate actions as they are about to take them.
These commit the speaker to fulfilling the action and communicate to addressees what actions will be taken.


```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(220) Messenger: Yeah so I'd have to get rid of one.
(221) Pilot: Right.
(222) Pilot: So you'd have to get
(223) Pilot: Yeah that's probably not a good idea.
(224) Engineer: So I'll just hold on to it.
---
(224) -- Commit --> (220)
```
The group discusses the strengths and weaknesses of a particular action, and in response, the Engineer commits to holding on to a resource (a card) rather than using it.
