## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a question which does not expect an answer, or where the answer is obvious or serving a rhetorical purpose.


## Examples

```
(354) Messenger: Would I have to discard?
(355) Engineer: Um
(356) Pilot: Hmm do you have to? You only have five.
---
(356) -- RhetoricalQuestion --> (354)
```
The Pilot's question in (356) is rhetorical, as it is not expecting an answer and is instead making a point about the Messenger's hand size, answering their question on (354).

```
(430) Server: W stole a resource from T
(431) Server: W built a settlement.
(432) T: what was that? :D
---
(432) -- RhetoricalQuestion --> (430)
```
T's question in (432) is rhetorical, as the answer is given from the Server in (430).
The purpose of the question is to express surprise or amusement, not to elicit a response.
