## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a narrative, descriptive or personal statement. These include:
- narrative (pieces of story)
- declarative statements of facts, possibly in situated in the dialogue setting ("boulder is north of denver", "I just drew three cards")
- personal statements (I was born in chicago, I get along well with my boss)
Statements that are personal differ from [Opinion](../Opinion) in that it is something the listener doesn't really "get to be an expert on".
If the statement is about something more general, that the listener could conceivably have their own (possibly differing) opinion about, then it will be [Opinion](../Opinion).
