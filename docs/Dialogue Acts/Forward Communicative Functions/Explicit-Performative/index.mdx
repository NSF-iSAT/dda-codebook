## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is an utterance where the speaker explicitly declares what is performed by the speaker, as in firing someone by saying "You're fired", or apologizing as "I apologize".

A good intuitive test for the explicit performative class is whether you can insert the word "hereby" before the verb.
For example, since "You're hereby fired" has approximately the same meaning as "You're fired", we know this is an explicit performative.
The utterance "I want to go to the store" is not since "I hereby want to go to the store" is difficult to interpret, and in contexts where it might be understandable, the meaning would have changed.

:::note
This does not include situations where the speaker is narrating their performance of an action: the act must be the speech itself.

For example:

```
(1) A: I'll take my game piece and move three places over to this tile.
```
is **not** an explicit-performative, as the speech is not the action itself.

## Examples

```
(1) A: I recommend the book.
---
(1) -- Explicit Performative --> (1)
```
The speaker explicitly declares that they are making a recommendation.

```
(1) A: I apologize for the mistake.
---
(1) -- Explicit Performative --> (1)
```
The speaker explicitly declares that they are apologizing (this is additionally an [Apology](../Apology)).

```
(1) A: You're fired!
---
(1) -- Explicit Performative --> (1)
```
To fire someone is a speech act.

```
(1) A: I have an interview tomorrow for my dream school.
(2) B: I wish you very good luck with it!
---
(2) -- Explicit Performative --> (1)
```
Speaker B's wishes are declared through the wishful sentence itself.

```
(1) A: I bet you that is a lily.
---
(1) -- Explicit Performative --> (1)
```
The speaker completed her/his bet through the betting utterance.
