## Examples

```
(124) T: Alright, let's hit next.
---
(124) -- Proposal --> (124)
```
T makes a proposal for a course of action for the group to take.

```
(238) Pilot: I'd probably shore up as much as you can
(239) Engineer: Ok.
(240) Messenger: Uh yeah so move (--)
(241) Engineer: So I can move
(242) Pilot: Mmhmm. And like shore up those two.
---
(242) -- Proposal --> (238)
```
The pilot suggests a course of action for the *Engineer* to take.
Qualifiers like "probably" indicate the speaker is open to the proposal being rejected.

```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(148) Messenger: Temple of the Moon. You have that one Ok.
(149) Pilot: So I'll do the Helicopter lift, move you guys to the Crystal?
---
(149) -- Proposal --> (148)
```
The Pilot proposes a course of action for the *group* to take.
While many of the actions in the course are undertaken by the speaker (e.g. an Offer to use the Helicopter lift),
there is also implicitly a proposal for the entire groups trajectory in the cooperative game.
