## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is an imperative or command.


## Examples

```
(80) T: Hold on hold on.
(81) T: Look at this.
---
(81) -- ActionDirective --> (80)
```
Direct imperatives or commands are Action Directives.

```
(1) A: Can you pass me the salt?
---
(1) -- ActionDirective --> (1)
```
Some questions are a request for action, which can be considered an Action Directive whenever it would be unexpected for the addressee to reject the request.

```
(244) Pilot: Ok.
(245) Engineer: And then I need two of those [cards].
---
(245) -- ActionDirective --> (244)
```
The Engineer is making an implicit request for the Pilot to give them two cards.
Since there is no indication that the Engineer is open to the Pilot rejecting this request, it can be considered an Action Directive.

```
(334) Pilot: You should probably try to shore up
---
(334) -- ActionDirective --> (334)
```
While there is a hedge ("probably") in this directive, it is still not inviting the possibility of rejection, so it can be considered an Action Directive.
