## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a question that does not request particular information and is open-ended.
These are mostly of the "how about you" variety; These are meant to address the kind of questions which we think place few if any syntactic constraints on the form of the answer.

Example open questions:
- How about you?
- What do you think?
- How about yours?
- What are your opinions on it?
- What do you think about the benefits in jobs?
- How about your community?
