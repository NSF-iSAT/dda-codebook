## Definition

**Used when:** used when the source argument does not seem to be intended for the listener to respond to, or talking to one-self.
Typically these are self-pointing (source and target slash-units are the same), but this can also be used to connect multi-slash-unit self-talk, or
in connection to a previous slash-unit that is not self-talk.


## Examples

```
(45) A: Wait, no.
---
(45) -- SelfTalk --> (45)
```
In (45), A is talking to themselves while completing a task.

```
(195) Messenger: And then you need three.
(196) Pilot: mm two three.
---
(196) -- SelfTalk --> (195)
```
In (196) the Pilot is counting to themselves, but prompted by the target utterance indicating how many items are needed.

## Conventions

- Self-talk can be used as part of indicating [Reading Aloud](../../../Conventions/readingaloud.mdx) behaviors.
