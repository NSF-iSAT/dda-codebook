## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is *evidence* that the speaker has abandoned their original utterance in the target argument.
**Abandoned** is used if the target utterance is cut off in such a way that you can't readily tell what it would have been.
However, as noted above, this is annotated on the source argument **from the same speaker**, which provides evidence that the target utterance was abandoned, rather than [Incomplete](../../Other/Incomplete)
