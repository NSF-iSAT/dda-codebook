## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a signal that the speaker is buying some time.
This includes both 'Stalling' and 'Pausing' acts in SWBD-DAMSL:
1. the speaker is unable to say immediately what he/she intended to say (Stalling)
2. the speaker suspends the dialogue for a while (Pausing).
DDA does not distinguish between these two cases, and uses the label **Stalling** for both.



## Examples

```
(1) A: Do you have your ticket with you?
(2) B: ehm, let me see, well,...
---
(2) -- Stalling --> (1)
```
B is stalling as they search for their ticket in response to A's question in (1).

```
(1) A: ...yeah um like...
---
(1) -- Stalling --> (1)
```
The speaker can also stall to hold the conversational floor.

```
(36) Pilot: Think which one we should be careful of?
(37) Messenger: Um
---
(37) -- Stalling --> (36)
```
In (37), the Messenger is stalling as they prepare to answer the Pilot's question in (36).
