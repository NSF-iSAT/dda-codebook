## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a back-channel/continuer which communicates that the speaker is listening and processing the information in the target argument, without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing with it.
[Accept](../Accept/), [Appreciation](../Appreciation/), and [Reject](../Reject/) include the act of acknowledgement, so it does not need to be labeled explicitly in those cases.

Some example continuers and their frequency in SWBD-DAMSL:

```
38%  uh-huh
34%  yeah
9%   right
3%   oh
2%   yes
2%   okay
2%   oh yeah
1%   huh
1%   sure
1%   um
1%   huh-uh
1%   uh
```
Unlike SWBD-DAMSL, we do not distinguish between the back-channels `b` and the back-channels which take the form of a question `bh`.
These are all considered as Acknowledgement.

## Examples

```
(131) A: Click on basic.
(132) A: Click on that.
(133) B: yup
---
(133) -- Acknowledge --> (131)
```

```
(555) Messenger: Watchtower
(556) Messenger: Misty Marsh and Temple of the Sun.
(557) Messenger: And Watchtower
(558) Messenger: This one.
(559) Pilot: Ok so any suggestions?
---
(559) -- Acknowledge --> (555)
```
Acknowledgement ("Ok") can be contained in an utterance which includes further acts, such as a question in (559).

```
(1) A: I've been volunteering at the animal shelter every weekend.
(2) B: Oh, really?
---
(2) -- Acknowledge --> (1)
```

```
(1) A: They decided to move the deadline up by a whole week.
(2) B: Is that right?
---
(2) -- Acknowledge --> (1)
```

```
(1) A: Turns out he grew up just a few blocks from where I did.
(2) B: Oh, yeah?
---
(2) -- Acknowledge --> (1)
```

```
(1) H: I'm Harry, Sir. Harry Potter.
(2) A: Good lord. Are you really?
---
(2) -- Acknowledge --> (1)
```
