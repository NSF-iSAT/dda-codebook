title: Signal Non Understanding
sidebar_position: 1
---

## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument explicitly indicates a problem in understanding the target argument.
As an applicability test for **Signal-non-understanding**, you should be able to roughly paraphrase a Signal-non-understanding utterance as "What did you say/mean?".
Note that not all clarification questions signal non-understanding.
**Typically requests to repeat or clarify previous utterances.**

## Examples

```
Context: utt1: A: Take the train to Dansville
  SNU            B: Huh?.                  (i.e., What did you say?)
  SNU            B: What did you say?.     (i.e., What did you say?)
  SNU            B: to Dansville?          (i.e., What did you say?)
  SNU            B: did you say Dansville? (i.e., What did you say?)
  SNU            B: Dansville, New York?   (i.e., What did you mean?)
  SNU            B: Which train?           (i.e., What did you mean?)
```
Examples from SWBD-DAMSL.

```
(4) Engineer: Gold Gate and Cities of Abandon.
(5) Pilot: Which one?
---
(5) -- SignalNonUnderstanding --> (4)
```
In (5), the Pilot is indicating they did not hear or understand the locations mentioned by the Engineer in (4), by asking for the same information again.

### NON-Examples

```
(1) A: We should go to the store.
(2) B: Which store?
---
(**NOT** a SignalNonUnderstanding)
```
In (2), B is not indicating a problem in understanding A's utterance in (1), but is instead asking for more details not provided in (1).
