## Definition

**Used when:** The source argument indicates the speaker agrees (fully or partially) with the statement, proposal, plan, opinion or situation in the target argument.
The Agreements (Accept, Reject, Partial Accept etc) all mark the degree to which speaker accepts some previous proposal, plan, opinion, or statement.


## Examples

```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(220) Messenger: Yeah so I'd have to get rid of one.
(221) Pilot: Right.
---
(221) -- Accept --> (220)
```
(221) indicates agreement with the previous claim in (220).

```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(243) Engineer: I can shore up both of these.
(244) Pilot: Ok.
---
(244) -- Accept --> (243)
```
In (243), the engineer makes a commitment to shore up two locations on the board, and (244) indicates the pilot's acceptance of that commitment.
Here "Ok." indicates acceptance (as opposed to only acknowledgement) because of the collaborative game-play setting:
speakers are uttering their plans and commitments to coordinate team strategy.
