## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument utterance completes another speaker's utterance (target), either finishing their sentence or simultaneously completing the sentence.
Collaborative Completions also function as an understanding-check.
They often get responses which indicate understanding.


## Examples

[simultaneously spoken:]

(478) Messenger: Mm yeah but I have to [wait till my turn.]
(479) Pilot: But they'd [have to be your turn]
---
(479) -- CollaborativeCompletion --> (478)
```
Two speakers complete the thought of the first speaker on (478).

```
(5) A: In other words, you'd have to, murder more than one other person --
(6) B: Besides him.
---
(6) -- CollaborativeCompletion --> (5)
```
In (6) speaker B completes the sentence of speaker A, confirming their mutual understanding.
