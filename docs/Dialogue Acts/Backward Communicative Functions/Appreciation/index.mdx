## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is a backchannel/continuer which functions to express slightly more emotional involvement and support than just "uh-huh".
Appreciation dialogue acts represent a response to a positive situation.


## Examples

```
(402) Engineer: Copper Gate
(403) Messenger: That's good.
---
(403) -- Appreciation --> (402)
```
The outcome of drawing a card (402) is appreciated by the Messenger in (403).

```
(386) Pilot: Oh that's good.
---
(386) -- Appreciation --> (386)
```
Self-pointing appreciation can be used when the target is not identifiable as any particular prior slash-unit(s).
The true target may be abstract or just not verbalized, e.g. if the speakers are collaborating on a hands-on task.
