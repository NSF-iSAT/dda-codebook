## Convention

Often in classroom or game-play settings, speakers read aloud a passage, question, instruction, or item from a game such as a card.
In these cases, the speech may or may not be intended for a listener to hear, but it is not expected to be responded to directly.

To annotate this behavior, we use the combination of **[Self-talk](../Dialogue%20Acts/Communicative%20Status/Self-talk)** and **[Statement](../Dialogue%20Acts/Forward%20Communicative%20Functions/Statement)** labels.

## Examples
```
<drawing three cards in Forbidden Island>

(196) Pilot: mm two three.
(197) Engineer: Um three.
(198) Pilot: Copper Gate, Crimson Forest and Howling Garden.
---
(198) -- SelfTalk --> (196)
(198) -- Statement --> (196)
```
In (198), the Pilot is reading aloud the three cards drawn. The target is (196) as the reading aloud is in response to the act of drawing those cards.

```
<drawing three cards in Forbidden Island>

(499) Pilot: Coral Palace Whispering Garden Temple of the Moon
---
(499) -- SelfTalk --> (499)
(499) -- Statement --> (499)
```
In other cases, there is not a target slash-unit the reading aloud is in clear response to, so a self-pointing edge is used.
