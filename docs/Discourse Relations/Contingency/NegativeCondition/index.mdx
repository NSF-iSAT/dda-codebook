## Definition

**Used when:** one argument (the antecedent) describes a situation presented as unrealized, which if it **does not** occur, would lead to the situation described by the other argument (the consequent).
There are distinct senses for interpreting the arguments in terms of semantics or speech acts, with the default being semantics.
