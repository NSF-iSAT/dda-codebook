## Definition

**Used when:** one argument presents a situation as unrealized (the antecedent), which (when realized) would lead to the situation described by the other arg (the consequent). There are distinct senses for interpreting the arguments in terms of their semantics or the speech acts they convey. The default is their semantics.

### Subtypes
- [Conditioning](./conditioning.mdx) is used when the source argument presents a condition (the antecedent), which (if realized) would lead to the situation described by the target argument (the consequent). i.e. *This* is conditioning *That*.
- [ConditionedBy](./conditionedby.mdx) is used when the source argument presents a situation (the consequent), which would occur if the situation in the target argument is realized (the antecedent). i.e. *This* is conditioned by *That*.
