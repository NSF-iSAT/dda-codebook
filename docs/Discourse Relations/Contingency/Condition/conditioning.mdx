## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument presents a condition (the antecedent), which (if realized) would lead to the situation described by the target argument (the consequent).

i.e. *This* is conditioning *That*.

## Examples

```
(120) Teacher: So it could be like doing blue and green or something
(121) Teacher: when the sound is lower.
---
(121) -- Conditioning --> (120)
```

```
(92) Teacher: It should only play
(93) Teacher: if the intensity is greater than one thousand.
---
(93) -- Conditioning --> (92)
```

```
(193) Messenger: Move me to Fool's Landing if you're looking to burn a card.
---
(193) -- Conditioning --> (193)
```
