## Definition

**Used when:** the situation described by one argument presents the manner in which the situation described by other argument has happened or been done.
Manner answers "how" questions such as "How were the children playing?".
While Manner may be the only relation that holds between two arguments, it is often the case that another sense (Purpose, Result or Condition) is taken to hold as well.
