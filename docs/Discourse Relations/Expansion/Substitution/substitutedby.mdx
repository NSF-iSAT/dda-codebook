## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument is an alternative which is replaced by the alternative presented in the target argument, explicitly ruling out the source argument.

i.e. *This* is substituted by *That*

## Examples

```
(1) A: We should do Z,
(2) A: instead of X and Y.
---
(2) -- SubstitutedBy --> (1)
```
(1) suggests an alternative Z which replaces X and Y explicitly.

```
<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(243) Pilot: I'll give you the card,
(244) Pilot: instead of shoring up.
---
(244) -- Substituted By --> (243)
```
The pilot identifies an alternative (244, shoring up) which is explicitly replaced by the alternative presented in (243), giving the card.
