## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument presents an alternative to the target argument, explicitly replacing or ruling out the target argument.

i.e. *This* is substituting *That*

## Examples

```
(1) A: We should do X and Y.
(2) B: Let's do Z instead.
---
(2) -- Substituting --> (1)
```
B suggests an alternative Z to X and Y that should replace them explicitly.

<in a collaborative board game: Forbidden Island>

(243) Pilot: Oh maybe I won't shore up.
(244) Pilot: I'll give you the card [instead].
---
(244) -- Substituting --> (243)
```
The pilot substitutes their previous decision (243) with a new one (244), explicitly ruling out the previous decision.
