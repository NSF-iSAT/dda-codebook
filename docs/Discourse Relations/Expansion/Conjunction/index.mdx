## Definition

**Used when:** both arguments bear the same relation to some other situation evoked in the discourse.
It indicates that the two arguments make the same contribution with respect to that situation, or contribute to it together.
It differs from most other relations in that the arguments don't directly relate to each other, but to this other situation.

(1) A: We should do X and Y.
(2) B: And Z, too.
---
