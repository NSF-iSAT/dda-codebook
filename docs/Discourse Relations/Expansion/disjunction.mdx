title: Disjunction (Alternative)
sidebar_position: 2
---

## Definition

**Used when:** the two arguments are presented as alternatives, with either one or both holding.
As with Conjunction, Disjunction is used when both its arguments bear the same relation to some other situation evoked in the discourse, making a similar contribution with respect to that situation.
While the arguments also relate to each other as alternatives (with one or both holding), they also both relate in the same way to this other situation.

## Examples

```
(1) A: We should do X and Y.
(2) A: Or we could do Z instead.
---
(2) -- Disjunction --> (1)
```
(2) suggests an alternative to the choices in (1).

```

---

```
