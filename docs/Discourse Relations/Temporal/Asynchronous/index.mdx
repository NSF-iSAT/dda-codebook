## Definition

Used when: the events or situations in the two arguments are temporally ordered. If the order is known,
instead use the sub-types [Before](./before.mdx) or [After](./after.mdx).

### Sub-types
- [Before](./before.mdx) is used when the connective indicates that the situation in the source argument precedes or occurs **before** the situation described in target argument.
- [After](./after.mdx) the connective indicates that the situation in the source argument follows or occurs **after** the situation described in target argument.

## Examples

```
Example 1:
(1) A: I won't be available from 3-4pm, I have a meeting at that time
(2) B: Ok, I'll reach out at a different time then
---
(2) --Asynchronous--> (1)
```

B 'reaching out' and A's meeting are temporally ordered and not overlapping, but the exact order is not specified.

```
