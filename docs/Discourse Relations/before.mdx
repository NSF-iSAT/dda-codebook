## Definition

Used when: the connective indicates that the situation in Arg1 (source) precedes or occurs before the situation described in Arg2 (target).

## Examples

```
Example 1:
(1) A: we are going to start with an evaluation
(2) A: after we form small groups.
(2) --Before--> (1)
```

**Note:** Since response dependencies point to previous slash units in a conversation, 
the linguistic cue "after" in the source slash unit (2) indicates the *inverse* relation "before" when depending on the target (1) slash unit.
