## Definition

**Used when:** the connective indicates that Arg1 and Arg2 share a predicate or property and a difference is highlighted with respect to the values assigned to the shared property. 
In "**Contrast**", neither argument describes a situation that is asserted on the basis of the other one.
In this sense, there is no directionality in the interpretation of the arguments.
This is an important difference between the interpretation of "**Contrast**" and [**Concession**](./Concession/).

i.e. *This* constrasts with *That*

## Examples

```
(1) A: The weather was bad over the weekend.
(2) B: It's nice now, though.
---
(2) -- Contrast --> (1)
```
B contrasts the current weather with the previous weather described by A, highlighting the difference in the weather conditions.
It is not a concession though, as A is not making any claims about the current weather.
