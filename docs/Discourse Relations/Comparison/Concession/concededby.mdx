## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument describes a situation or set of facts that for which the target argument provides a concession.

i.e. *This* is conceded by *That*

## Examples

```
(1) B: Although we still need to get back here,
(2) B: I think we are good.
---
(2) -- ConcededBy --> (1).
```

In (1), B concedes that there is still a task to be done (and thus they might not be 'good'), but in (2) B asserts that they are good. The first argument gives a concession for the situation described in the second argument.
