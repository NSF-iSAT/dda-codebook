## Definition

**Used when:** the source argument describes a concession to the situation or facts in the target argument.

i.e. *This* is conceding something with respect to *That*

## Examples

```
(1) A: we have one more step to go.
(2) A: I think we are good.
(3) B: Although we still need to get back here.
---
(3) -- Conceding --> (1)
```
In (2), A asserts that they are good, but B's response in (3) is conceding that there are circumstances that might contradict A's assertion, in this case an unfinished task.

(478) Messenger: Mm yeah [that's a good suggestion]
(479) Messenger: but I have to wait till my turn [by which time it may no longer be the best move]
