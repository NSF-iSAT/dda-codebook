## Definition

**Used when:** the connective indicates that one of the arguments describes a situation A which causes C, while the other asserts (or implies) **not** C.
Alternatively, one argument denotes a fact that triggers a set of potential consequences, while the other denies one or more of them.

### Subtypes
- [Conceding](./conceding.mdx)
- [ConcededBy](./concededby.mdx)

## Examples

```
(1) A: we have one more step to go.
(2) A: I think we are good.
(3) B: Although we still need to get back here.
---
(3) -- Conceding --> (1)
```
In (2), A asserts that they are good, but B's response in (3) is conceding that there are circumstances that might contradict A's assertion, in this case an unfinished task.
