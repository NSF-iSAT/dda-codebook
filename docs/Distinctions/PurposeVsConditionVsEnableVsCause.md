### Purpose, Condition, Cause

1. `Condition`, `Purpose` are restricted for **potential, hypothetical, or future – non-factive** – connections between cause and effect.
2. `Purpose` has a specifically goal-oriented facet: The dependent is an activity that is performed for achieving the state of affairs in the head.
3. If cause and effect are being described as factive, then `Cause` can be used, which differ solely in the distribution of dependent and head.
4. `Motivation` can only be used when the hearer is encouraged to perform a certain activity (provided by the nucleus) or to be convinced, on the grounds of the head slash unit.
