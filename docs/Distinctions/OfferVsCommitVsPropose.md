:::note
**Offer**, **Commit**, and **Propose** all carry the potential to commit someone to a course of action.

- Both **Offer** and **Commit** potentially commit the *speaker* to some course of action:
  - In an **Offer**, commitment of the speaker is conditioned on the *agreement of the addressee*.
  - For a **Commit**, this agreement is not required.
- Some **Proposals** are for a course of action, possibly committing the group or different parties. If it is unclear from the context whether the taker of the action is the speaker, then **Proposal** can be used. Similarly, **Proposals** can be used for courses of action taken as a group, or for a particular party that is not the speaker.
