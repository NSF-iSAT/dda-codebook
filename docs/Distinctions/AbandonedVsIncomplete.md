:::note
When considering cut-off or incomplete utterances, **Abandoned** is used when the source slash-unit provides evidence that the speaker of the source slash-unit has abandoned their previous speech in the target slash-unit (i.e. both source and target must be from the same speaker). When a different speaker cuts-off a previous utterance, this is not considered abandoned, and the cut off slash-unit can be annotated as **Incomplete**.
