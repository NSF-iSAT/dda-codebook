:::note
It is often appropriate to label a slash-unit as both a **Proposal** and **Task-Management** or as an **Action-Directive** and **Task-Management**, when the proposal or imperative is part of a future goal or task, not immediately achieved by the next actions.

For example, "let's click the round button next" is both a proposal for a next course of action, and manages status in a longer running task. Including **Task-Management** is appropriate for proposals or imperatives that can be interpreted as being part of longer running tasks with steps in the future, beyond the immediate next actions.
